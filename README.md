This project will use Tableau to visualize data for a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display information to potential investors about bike-sharing rental stations in Des Moines, Iowa. The bike-sharing would be similar to Citi Bike in New York City. The data collected, analyzed, and visualized from Citi Bike will help with determining what we may expect to see in Des Moines. The Tableau story created in this project will provide a story of the data — this will aid investors in making a decision on whether to support our bike rental company. 

## Results
#### To accurately visualize the data collected, multiple charts were created. The results of each chart are explained in the following section.
The chart below displays the length of time for which the bikes were checked out. For example, at approximately 3 pm, there were 5 bikes checked out for 34 minutes. This chart tells us that with the exception of a few hours within the day, people tend to rent bikes for longer periods of time (20 minutes or more) than just for a few minutes.

The “Trips for Weekday for Each Hour” chart below portrays how many bikes are rented out for each hour in each day of the week. This chart tells us that weekday evenings — specifically Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday between 5 and 6 PM — have the highest bike rentals. However, weekends between 10 AM and 6 PM have a fairly constant rental rate throughout New York City. Early mornings, late nights, and working hours during the week have low rental periods

The “Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)” chart allows us to see the times of each day that bikes rented out to people grouped by gender. From this chart, we can see that Monday through Thursday mornings between 8 - 10 AM, as well as Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings between 5 - 7 PM are the heaviest bike rental periods of the week. In addition, we can see that there’s an almost constant rate of bike-sharing rentals on Saturday and Sunday between 11 AM and 5 PM. From this chart, we can use the data to determine where to place bike stations and advertisements for this bike-sharing business.

The following chart compares the number of subscribers (annual members) and the customers (one-time rentals) grouped by gender. From this chart, we can see that a vast majority of bike-share renters are subscribers. Within this group, we can see that there are more males than females or renters of an unknown gender. In addition, men and women tend to rent bikes on Thursday and Friday more than any other day. One interesting aspect of this chart is that there are a higher number of rentals for customers of all genders: male, female, and unknown.

The “August Peak Hours” chart below portrays the highest rental hours within August. The chart shows the busiest time for bike-share rentals to be between 5 and 7 pm with a fairly busy period between 7 am and 7 pm. The data in this chart can help us decide when to repair bikes so the repairs do not disrupt customers nor do they leave less bikes at the stations.

The charts below shows us the top locations where bikes are rented and returned. The maps show how the starting and ending locations are in close proximity to each other. This data is critical in viewing who the bike-share renters may be and where the most profitable stations could be placed in Des Moines. The first step would be to look at which areas are in high-tourist areas versus areas which tend to be a local area.

The following chart tells us the average trip duration for people grouped by birth year, or in other words, age. This chart describes how, with the exclusion of a few anomalies, people born in a later year (specifically 1995 onwards), tend to have longer bike rides. This data could be useful in looking at station placement near universities and colleges.

The “Bike Utilization” chart below shows us specific bikes that are used more often than others. From this chart, we can compare various Bike ID’s to pinpoint which ones to repair.

## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the visualizations give us data to view on who the customers are based on gender and age; the highest rental periods of time; and the stations with the most rentals and returns. This data can provide us with key information to help us make decisions in ensuring our bike-sharing business is profitable. In order to make future decisions, we will need to make further visualizations and/or collect more data.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to provide the best repair service, it may be helpful to track when a bike is returned by tracking its bike ID at the station. We can, then, make a visualization of the bike stations with the most rented bikes. From this, we can make decisions on the bike repairs to attend to based on convenience to riders.
Another piece of data to look at along with the Citi Bike data is the starting and ending locations by adding specific areas of New York to the map. This would include adding NYU, Columbia University, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, and so on. From this, we can pinpoint whether the busiest stations were in a similar vicinity to a university or touristy area. The data from a map similar to this would aid us in placing stations around the Des Moines area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data we have available to us can help in numerous ways. However, in order to provide the most accurate and informative data to the investor, further charts would need to be created.
